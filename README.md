# Bank Management System

This project is a **Bank Management System** developed in **Java** using **Swing** for the graphical user interface and **MySQL** for database management.  
It simulates real-world banking operations to help users understand core features of banking applications and strengthens skills in **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**, **GUI development**, and **database connectivity**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Bank Management System is designed to perform essential banking operations including:
- Creating a new bank account  
- Secure login using card number and PIN  
- Balance inquiry  
- Cash deposit  
- Cash withdrawal  
- Mini statement generation  
- Fast cash options  
- PIN change

The system uses a **modular and event-driven design**, making it easier to understand and maintain.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
