Bank Management System

The Bank Management System is a Java-based application developed to simulate basic banking operations.

The project uses Java Swing for the graphical user interface and MySQL as the backend database with JDBC connectivity.

It allows users to create a bank account and log in securely using a card number and PIN.

Users can perform banking operations such as deposit, cash withdrawal, balance enquiry, fast cash, mini statement, and PIN change.

The system follows a modular and event-driven design, making the application easy to understand and maintain.

This project is developed for academic and learning purposes to gain practical knowledge of GUI programming, database management, and object-oriented concepts.
